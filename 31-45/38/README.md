# Exercise No. 38

Define a function called `acronym()` that takes as an argument - words and return the acronym of the given words (see below):


    'object oriented programming' -> 'OOP'


**Examples:**


    [IN]: acronym('object oriented programming')
    [OUT]: 'OOP'


    [IN]: acronym('Python Software Foundation')
    [OUT]: 'PSF'


You don't need to implement validation in your solution.


**Note!** You only need to define the function.
