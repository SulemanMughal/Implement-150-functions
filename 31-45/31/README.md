# Exercise No. 31

Define a function called `preprocess()` that takes a list of tuples as an argument and removes all single-element tuples from that list.


**Example:**


    [IN]: preprocess([(4, 5), (4, ), (5, 2), (5, 3, 2), (5, )])
    [OUT]: [(4, 5), (5, 2), (5, 3, 2)]


You don't need to implement validation in your solution.


**Note!** You only need to define the function.
