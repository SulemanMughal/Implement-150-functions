# Exercise No. 43

Define a function called `pascal_traingle()` that takes one argument:

-   *row* - row number in Pascal's triangle

and returns as a list the coefficients corresponding to the given row of Pascal's triangle.


**Examples:**


    [IN]: pascal_triangle(4)
    [OUT]: [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]


    [IN]: pascal_triangle(3)
    [OUT]: [1, 3, 3, 1]


**Tip!** You can use the factorial function from the math built-in module or implement a helper function to compute the factorial.


You don't need to implement validation in your solution.


**Note!** You only need to define the function.
