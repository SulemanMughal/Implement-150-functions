# Exercise No. 146

Define a function `called to_csv()` that creates a comma separated string (CSV) from any number of arguments passed.


**Examples:**


    [IN]: to_csv(3, 5)
    [OUT]: '3,5'


    [IN]: to_csv('open', 'high', 'low', 'close')
    [OUT]: 'open,high,low,close'


    [IN]: to_csv(54.6, 34.6, 35.3)
    [OUT]: '54.6,34.6,35.3'


You don't need to implement validation in your solution.


**Note!** You only need to define the function.
