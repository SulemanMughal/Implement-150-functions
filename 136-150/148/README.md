# Exercise No. 148

Define a function called `slope()` that, based on two points on the plane, calculates the slope of a line (y = ax + b) that passes through these two points.


**Examples:**


    [IN]: slope((1, 3), (2, 6))
    [OUT]: 3.0


    [IN]: slope((-2, 3), (4, 6))
    [OUT]: 0.5


You don't need to implement validation in your solution.


**Note!** You only need to define the function.
