# Exercise No. 21

Define a function called `calculate()` that takes a list as an argument and performs the following transformations:

-   multiplies all odd numbers by 2


**Example:**


    [IN]: calculate([4, 5, 6, 7])
    [OUT]: [4, 10, 6, 14]


    [IN]: calculate([9, 6, 3, 7, 11, 31, 40])
    [OUT]: [18, 6, 6, 14, 22, 62, 40]


You don't need to implement validation in your solution.


**Note!** You only need to define the function.
