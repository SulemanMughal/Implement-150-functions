# Exercise No. 24

Define a function called `count()` that takes a list as an argument and returns the number of positive and negative numbers (we consider zero to be a positive number) in the given list (see below).


**Example:**


    [IN]: count([4, 5, 6])
    [OUT]: (3, 0)


    [IN]: count([5, 2, -1, -5, -2])
    [OUT]: (2, 3)


You don't need to implement validation in your solution.


**Note!** You only need to define the function.
