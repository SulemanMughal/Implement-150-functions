# Exercise No. 23

Define a function called `replace_neg()` that takes a list of numbers as an argument and replaces any negative number with 0.


**Example:**


    [IN]: replace_neg([4, -5, 2, 0, -4])
    [OUT]: [4, 0, 2, 0, 0]


    [IN]: replace_neg([-10, -5, 8, -3, 7, -2])
    [OUT]: [0, 0, 8, 0, 7, 0]


You don't need to implement validation in your solution.


**Note!** You only need to define the function.
