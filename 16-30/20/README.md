# Exercise No. 20

Define a function called `distance()` that takes two lists and returns the distance of these two lists measured by the greatest difference over the corresponding elements in those lists.


**Example:**


    [IN]: distance([3, 4, 6, 2], [2, 1, 9, 14])
    [OUT]: 12


    [IN]: distance([3, 4, 6, 0, 1], [2, 1, 9, 7, 4])
    [OUT]: 7


You don't need to implement validation in your solution.


**Note!** You only need to define the function.
