# Exercise No. 25

Define a function called `preprocess()` that takes a string of the following form as an argument:

    '$ 975,400'


and converts that string to an integer.


**Example:**

    [IN]: preprocess('$ 975,400')
    [OUT]: 975400


    [IN]: preprocess('$ 158,400,800')
    [OUT]: 158400800


**Note!** You only need to define the function.
