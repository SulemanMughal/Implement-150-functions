# Exercise No. 83

Consider the compound annual capitalization model, where:

    *pv* - is the present value of the investment

    *r* - interest rate (annual)

   *n* - the number of years of investment

Implement a function called `fv()` that calculates the future value of investment rounded to two decimal places.

In response, print the future values of investment for the following cases:

-   `pv=1000, r=0.04, n=1`

-   `pv=1000, r=0.04, n=2`

-   `pv=1000, r=0.03, n=5`

-   `pv=10000, r=0.09, n=10`


**Expected result:**


    1040.0
    1081.6
    1159.27
    23673.64
