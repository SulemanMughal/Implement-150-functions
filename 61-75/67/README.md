# Exercise No. 67


The following list is given:


    items = [
        [1, 2, 3],
        [4, 5, 6],
        [7, 8, 9]
    ]


Implement a function called `flatten()`, which takes the nested list and returns the following:


    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

**Note!** You only need to define the function.
