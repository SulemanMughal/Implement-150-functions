we define the Euclidean distance by the formula:

![Euclidean Distance](./euclidean_distance_1.JPG)

Implement a function called `euclidean_distance()` that computes the distance between two points.


**Example:**


    [IN]: euclidean_distance([0, 3], [4, 0])
    [OUT]: 5.0


**Note!** You only need to define the function.
