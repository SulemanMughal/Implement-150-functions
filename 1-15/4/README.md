# Exercise No. 4


Define a function called `swap_elements()` that takes a list as argument and replaces the first and last elements of that list.


**Example:**


    [IN]: swap_elements([4, 5, 6, 7])
    [OUT]: [7, 5, 6, 4]


    [IN]: swap_elements([4, 5, 6, 7, 1])
    [OUT]: [1, 5, 6, 7, 4]


    [IN]: swap_elements([4, 5])
    [OUT]: [5, 4]


You don't need to implement validation in your solution.


**Note!** You only need to define the function.
