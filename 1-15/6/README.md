# Exercise No. 6


Define a function called `reverse_words()` that takes a sentence as an argument and reverses the order of words in the given sentence. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that the sentence doesn't contain any punctuation marks.


**Example:**

    [IN]: reverse_words('python is the best')
    [OUT]: 'best the is python'


    [IN]: reverse_words('you should learn python language')
    [OUT]: 'language python learn should you'


You don't need to implement validation in your solution.


**Note!** You only need to define the function.
