# Exercise No. 5

Define a function called `swap_elements()` that takes a list and two indices as arguments, and replaces the elements at the indicated indices.


**Example:**


    [IN]: swap_elements([4, 5, 6, 7, 1], 1, 2)
    [OUT]: [4, 6, 5, 7, 1]


    [IN]: swap_elements(['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'], 4, 2)
    [OUT]: ['A', 'B', 'E', 'D', 'C']


    [IN]: swap_elements([2.1, 5.2, 6.2, 7.1, 2.6, 2.1], 3, 2)
    [OUT]: [2.1, 5.2, 7.1, 6.2, 2.6, 2.1]


You don't need to implement validation in your solution.


**Note!** You only need to define the function.
