# Exercise No. 7

Define a function called `remove_common_elements()` that takes two lists as argument, removes their common elements, and returns these lists.


**Example:**


    [IN]: remove_common_elements([4, 3, 5, 2], [3, 8])
    [OUT]: ([4, 5, 2], [8])


    [IN]: remove_common_elements([4, 3, 5, 2], [1, 8])
    [OUT]: ([4, 3, 5, 2], [1, 8])


    [IN]: remove_common_elements([4, 3, 5, 2], [1, 3, 5, 8])
    [OUT]: ([4, 2], [1, 8])


You don't need to implement validation in your solution.


**Note!** You only need to define the function.
