# Exercise No. 8

Define a function called `get_indices()` that takes a list and the search keyword as arguments, and returns a list of all the indices that have the searched keyword in this list. If the keyword is not in the list, the function returns an empty list.


**Example:**


    [IN]: get_indices([4, 3, 5, 2], 2)
    [OUT]: [3]


    [IN]: get_indices(['Q', 'DQ', 'DQ', 'DQ', 'Q', 'Q'], 'Q')
    [OUT]: [0, 4, 5]


You don't need to implement validation in your solution.


**Note!** You only need to define the function.
