# Exercise No. 50


The data.csv file is attached to this exercise, containing basic data about the richest people in the world. Define a function called `all_technology()` that will read the given file and return as a list the names of the richest people in the tech sector - the `'Technology'` value for the `'Name'` column.


**Function call:**


    [IN]: all_technology()
    [OUT]: ['Jeff Bezos',
     'Bill Gates',
     'Larry Page',
     'Sergey Brin',
     'Larry Ellison',
     'Steve Ballmer',
     'Mark Zuckerberg']


**Tip!** You can use the preprocess() function to read the contents of the file.


**Note!** You only need to define the function.
